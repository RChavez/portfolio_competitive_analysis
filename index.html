	  <td>Interactivity:</td>
	  <td><p>JC Photography features a small amount of interactivity. It offers a few clickable links to various off site pages.
	    Also available is a navigational button that the user can click to control the display of pictures. Hidden in the corner of the
	    site is a group of share links that appear upon hovering over text.</p>

	  <td>Navigation:</td>
	  <td><p>Navigation is simple on JC's photo blog. The user controls the viewed pictures by scrolling down or clicking the button
	    corresponding to what the viewer wishes to see. Also availaable; although not easily notceable, is the option to view the
	    work in a full-screen mode (see image twenty). Other than these basic navigational options, there is very little to navigate to
	    in general.</p>
